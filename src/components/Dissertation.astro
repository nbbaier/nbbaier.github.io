         I investigate the sensitivity of φ-agreement to features typically
         associated with Ā-extraction, including those related to
         wh-questioning, relativization, focus and topicalization. This
         phenomenon has been referred to as anti-agreement (Ouhalla 1993) or
         wh-agreement (Chung and Georgopoulos 1988; Georgopoulos 1991; Chung
         1994) in the literature. While anti-agreement is commonly held to
         result from constraints on the Ā-movement of agreeing DPs, I argue that
         it reduces to an instance of wh-agreement, or the appearance of
         particular morphological forms in the presence of Ā-features. I develop
         a unified account of these Ā-sensitive φ-agreement effects in which
         they arise from the ability of φ-probes to copy both φ-features and
         Ā-features in the syntax, coupled with postsyntactic morphological
         operations that manipulate feature bundles containing both [φ] and [Ā].
         The empirical foundation of the work is a typological survey of
         Ā-sensitive φ-agreement effects in 63 genetically and geographically
         diverse languages. This study is the largest of its kind to examine
         these effects, and brings to light new generalizations both about the
         syntax of Ā-sensitive φ-agreement effects and the behavior of
         φ-features in the presence of Ā-features.
