                  I am a Chicago based linguist interested in syntax,
                  morphology, and typology. Previously, I was a postdoctoral
                  researcher and lecturer in the Department of Linguistics at
                  the Univerisity of British Columbia (2019-2020) and a
                  postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Linguistics at
                  McGill University (2017-2019). I have a PhD in linguistics
                  from University of California, Berkeley. I also have an M.A.
                  in Linguistics from Berkeley and a B.A. in Linguistics and
                  German from the University of Michigan. I've also spent some
                  time in the Department of Linguistics at MIT in the Fall of
                  2015.

                  My primary interests are in syntax, morphology, and typology.
                  My research focuses on the morphosyntax of Ā-dependencies,
                  including the interaction of phi-agreement and Ā-movement and
                  morphological reflexes of Ā-movement. More generally, I am
                  interested in theories of agreement and what they can tell us
                  about the grammar. On a broader scale, my work aims to meld
                  rigorous typological research with minimalist analysis.

                  I have conducted fieldwork on several understudied languages.
                  These include two languages of Senegal, Seereer (Atlantic) and
                  Noon (Cangin). Some of this work can be seen in my PhD
                  qualifying paper on long distance wh-dependencies in Seereer
                  and my presentations about adjective agreement in Noon. I have
                  also worked on indigenous languages of North America. While in
                  Berkeley I participated in the Karuk Treebank Project. While
                  at University of Michigan, I worked on Sally Thomason's
                  Montana Salish (Flathead) dictionary project.
